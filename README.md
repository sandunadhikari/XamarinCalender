# XamarinCalender
Dependency Service with Prism



I set-up all information which you provided for April 29th and April 30th into calendar. However, if you check data/details for another day in the calendar except April 29th and 30th, you will not get any data for that day because I settled data for April 29th and 30th only.
You can watch how this App is working for Android and iOS phones through the link that I mentioned below.
